            <h1>Sunglasses at Night</h1>
            <body>Sunglasses inhibit one's ability to use their night vision.

This is because they reflect the light of the moon and stars into your eyes, making it difficult for your pupils to contract. The pupilâ€™s job is to control how much light enters the eye, so if it can't contract, then your night vision will be impaired.

The sunglasses that are worn in the evening or at night can block out a lot of light. This means that when wearing them, one's eyes will not be able to adjust to a new level of darkness and this can lead to reduced night vision.

Night vision is a form of vision that allows us to see in the dark. It works by collecting light from the sky and turning it into a type of energy called "electromagnetic radiation." This radiation is then detected by special cells in our eyes and sent on to our brain for processing.

Night vision goggles, like those used by pilots, are designed to amplify available light so that we can see things more clearly. They do this by using infrared (IR) or near-infrared (NIR) light, which is invisible to humans but can be seen using night-vision goggles.

Sunglasses are designed specifically for daytime use and block out all ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight - including IR and NIR light. This means that wearing sunglasses at night will obstruct your ability to see objects with your night-vision goggles because they will not have any visible light coming through them.

Sunglasses are not the only thing that blocks out one's night vision. Other things include eye wear, hats, and even hair.

Sunglasses are a common item in most people's wardrobes, but they can have a negative effect on one's night vision.

The eye is not able to adjust to the dark if it is covered by sunglasses. This means that the person wearing them will not be able to see as well in the dark as someone who does not wear sunglasses.

When you are driving at night, it is important that you take off your sunglasses so that you can see more clearly.

Sunglasses are a fashion accessory and have a lot of benefits. They protect one's eyes from the sun, they can be used to hide one's identity, and they can make one look cool. However, there is an important downside to wearing sunglasses at night.

Night vision is the ability to see in low light conditions. It is not just about being able to see in the dark but also about being able to see objects that are very close up or far away. Night vision works best when it has a lot of light available. Sunglasses inhibit this because they block out all light coming from below eye level and above eye level, which means that night vision is impaired by them because it doesn't have enough light for its purposes.</body>
